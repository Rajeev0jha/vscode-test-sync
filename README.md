# AI Learning Plan: From Novice to "Decent" (6-9 Months, Flexible 1+ Hour/Day)

As a COBOL/Python programmer with DB exposure, this plan builds on your strengths for **AI-accelerated coding**—focusing on tools like GitHub Copilot in VS Code to speed up data analysis and generate business proposals (e.g., auto-drafting insights from CSVs). "Decent" = Building/deploying simple models, prompting AI for 2x faster code, and creating end-to-end workflows (data → model → Markdown summary).

## Key Principles
- **Daily Structure**: 20-30 min theory (videos/readings), 30-40+ min hands-on (Copilot-assisted coding in VS Code/Jupyter).
- **Tools**: VS Code + GitHub Copilot (or Codeium free alt), Anaconda for env, Kaggle for datasets, GitHub for versioning.
- **Flex Time**: Core ~1 hour; stretch to 2-3 on high-energy days. Accelerate if you finish early.
- **Tracking**: Weekly check-ins here—what clicked? Snags? I'll adapt.
- **Resources**: Free (Coursera audits, fast.ai, Handbook online). Business datasets (e.g., Superstore Sales for proposal mocks).
- **Endgame**: Prompt Copilot: "Analyze sales CSV, build regression, output proposal Markdown."

## Phases Overview

| Phase | Weeks | Focus | Goals | Hours (Core) |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| **1: Python for Data/AI** | 1-4 | NumPy/Pandas + Viz | Data wrangling like enhanced DB ops; Copilot for snippets. | ~28 |
| **2: ML Foundations** | 5-12 | Supervised ML (scikit-learn) | Train/tune models; auto-gen code for classification. | ~56 |
| **3: Deep Learning Basics** | 13-20 | Neural nets (PyTorch) | Image/text models; transfer learning for quick prototypes. | ~56 |
| **4: Practice & Integration** | 21-24 | Projects/Deployment | End-to-end proposals; Streamlit apps with AI insights. | ~28 |
| **5: Polish (Optional)** | 25-36 | Advanced/Specialize | NLP/time-series; COBOL code analyzer project. | ~84 |
